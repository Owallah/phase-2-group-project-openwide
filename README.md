# Usage

Upon running the application, you will be directed to the home page where you will find a header section with a quote and a 'Discover' button, and a body section with four blocks of text and images that provide quotes about music.

The navigation bar at the top of the page provides links to the home page, playlist page, and about page, as well as a toggle for a dark theme.

The playlist page displays a list of songs, with each song item showing the song's name, artist, and thumbnail image. You can search the playlist by entering a search term in the search bar at the top of the page. To reset the search, click the 'Reset' button.
